# I-Hash
I-Hash is a unique POW mining (SHA-256) based token created under Tradecoin Asset:EekwfLSAkbREneBHrXdZSRAEPvmijq71Nf2GDNqBStz4. The Î© (Omega) denotes resistance (proof of Burning Electricity) against work done by a machine to make token value worthful. Each I-Hash block can be claimed only via proof of hash (SHA-256) submitted by a miner with certain conditions in a specified time period. Each I-Hash block is a proof of an average ~4.29GH mining (Because of minimum difficulty set to 16^8 = 4294967296 hashes). I-Hash blocks can be mined on CPU, even offline but to submit block miner need an Internet connectivity. There will a fix supply of 1 million I-Hash Tokens. Which will be distributed in four different rounds, each round of 250k I-Hashes). For more information read our whitepaper available on waves forum.
